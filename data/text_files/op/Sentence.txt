139-305 [Our goal is a thriving community of users and developers of UIMA frameworks, supporting components for analysing unstructured content such as text, audio and video.

]
305-320 [What is UIMA?

]
320-510 [Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. 
]
510-572 [UIMA is a framework and SDK for developing such applications. ]
572-734 [An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or located-at. 
]
734-958 [UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into components, for example "language identification" -> "language specific segmentation" -> "sentence boundary detection" -> "entity detection (person/place names etc.)". 
]
958-1092 [Each component must implement interfaces defined by the framework and must provide self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files. ]
1092-1163 [The framework manages these components and the data flow between them. ]
1163-1301 [Components are written in Java or C++; the data that flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these languages. 
]
1301-1489 [UIMA additionally provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and can scale to very large volumes by replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.

]
1489-1706 [Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA specification (that specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by a technical committee within OASIS , a standards organization). 
]
1706-1804 [We invite and encourage you to participate in both the implementation and specification efforts.

]
1804-1901 [UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, audio and video. 
]
1901-2051 [It comprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++, with some support for Perl, Python and TCL.
